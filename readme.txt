This repository contains tutorial material related to well known SW design patterns.
There is one sub directory per pattern named after its target pattern.

A minimal implementation of each pattern is - being- constructed, together with some explanatory notes.
Mostly the implementations are PHP, but have added C++ in some cases. To be honest, translating of this type of code between the common languages seems easy - so I may revisit all of them to have examples in PHP, Javascript and C++. 

Mostly the patterns come from GoF, but will expand from here to include some of the more interesting Martin Fowler "enterprise" patterns.

As a general comment, the Factory patterns seem hardest for people to grasp - judging by Stackoverflow questions, but the whole topic of Dependency Injection (DI) and DI Containers seems also be troublesome. I have written a separate article on that - not becasue I'm an expert but to test my own understanding. Nevertheless it contains lots of good references and hopefully makes simple statements about a simple subject, that is often clouded by jargon.
